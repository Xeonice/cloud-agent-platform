## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Session page renders the live terminal and controls
The `/tasks/$taskId` page SHALL be the ONLY client-only route (route option `ssr: false`): it SHALL render a `pendingComponent` terminal skeleton on the server (never touching `window`), and on the client mount the `<Terminal>` component, connect to the task's authenticated WebSocket via the reused `TerminalSocket`, render the raw byte stream directly to the terminal (raw bytes SHALL NOT pass through the TanStack Query cache), display the live connection status, and provide DIRECT 1:1 keystroke input typed straight into the live `<Terminal>` as the SOLE live-terminal input surface — the xterm `onData` path SHALL forward each keystroke verbatim (Enter as `\r`, arrows, Ctrl-C, backspace; clipboard pastes auto-wrapped in `ESC[200~`/`ESC[201~`) to the lease-gated keystroke channel, seizing the write lease on first input — with NO separate command-input box and NO delayed-carriage-return submit hack on the live path. The page SHALL provide a connection-state affordance so that typing while the socket is not OPEN is visibly inert rather than silently dropped, and SHALL focus the terminal on mount. The page SHALL also present an approval surface for pending `PermissionRequest` decisions. Discrete control frames (task completion, lease/write-lock changes, approval decisions) SHALL be bridged back into the query cache via `queryClient.setQueryData(['tasks', id], …)` or invalidation. The WebSocket handshake SHALL authenticate via the existing token query parameter plus `bearer.<token>` subprotocol (browsers cannot set an `Authorization` header on WS) and SHALL NOT attempt to set request headers.

#### Scenario: Session page streams the live terminal
- **WHEN** the operator opens `/tasks/$taskId` for a running task
- **THEN** the client connects the WebSocket and writes the task's live byte stream directly to the `<Terminal>` component without routing raw bytes through the query cache

#### Scenario: Direct xterm typing is the sole live input and Enter submits
- **WHEN** the operator types into the live terminal and presses Enter
- **THEN** each keystroke is forwarded verbatim through the xterm `onData` path to the lease-gated keystroke channel (the write lease is seized on first input), and Enter is delivered as `\r` so the agent composer submits — with no separate command-input box and no delayed-carriage-return hack mediating the live path

#### Scenario: Typing into a non-deliverable socket is visibly inert
- **WHEN** the operator types while the WebSocket is not OPEN (closed/reconnecting/errored)
- **THEN** the page shows a connection-state affordance making the terminal visibly inert, rather than silently discarding the keystrokes

#### Scenario: Session route is server-rendered as a skeleton only
- **WHEN** the server renders `/tasks/$taskId`
- **THEN** it emits the terminal `pendingComponent` skeleton and accesses no `window`/browser-only globals, and the live terminal is constructed only after client hydration in an effect

#### Scenario: Pending approval surfaces on the session page
- **WHEN** a `PermissionRequest` is pending for the open task
- **THEN** the page shows an approval surface offering allow/deny, and submitting a decision resolves it independently of the write lock

#### Scenario: Control frame bridges back into the query cache
- **WHEN** a control frame indicating task completion or a lease change arrives over the WebSocket
- **THEN** the console updates the cached task entry via `queryClient.setQueryData`/invalidation so other views reflect the new status, while raw output bytes remain out of the cache

#### Scenario: Terminal falls back when xterm is unavailable
- **WHEN** the xterm runtime is unavailable on the client
- **THEN** the session page renders a fallback DOM line view (terminal-line dim/ok/warn) plus a command input row (the fallback path retains a line input because there is no live terminal to type into) instead of crashing
