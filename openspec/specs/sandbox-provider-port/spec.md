# sandbox-provider-port Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change agent-control-platform. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: SandboxProvider port exposing sandbox-mode as a capability
The system SHALL define a `SandboxProvider` port abstraction whose `provision()` method accepts a `ProvisionContext` (which no longer carries a `taskToken`, since there is no dial-back to authenticate) and returns a `SandboxConnection { taskId, baseUrl, wsUrl }` rather than `void`, so that callers can address the provisioned sandbox by container name and open its terminal WebSocket. The port SHALL continue to expose the execution sandbox mode (one of `read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`) as an explicit capability via `getSandboxMode()`, but that mode SHALL be treated as INFORMATIONAL only — under AIO Sandbox the real isolation boundary is the container with `seccomp=unconfined` plus network isolation, not the reported mode. The concrete OS-isolating implementation SHALL remain deferrable and swappable without changing callers. `teardownSandbox` SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: provision returns a SandboxConnection, not void
- **WHEN** a caller invokes `SandboxProvider.provision()` with a `ProvisionContext`
- **THEN** it returns a `SandboxConnection` carrying `taskId`, `baseUrl`, and `wsUrl`
- **AND** the returned handle is sufficient for the caller to open the sandbox terminal WebSocket without any further lookup

#### Scenario: ProvisionContext no longer carries a task token
- **WHEN** the `ProvisionContext` type accepted by `provision()` is inspected
- **THEN** it does not contain a `taskToken` field, because no dial-back handshake needs authenticating

#### Scenario: getSandboxMode is informational under AIO
- **WHEN** `getSandboxMode()` is called on the AIO-backed provider
- **THEN** the returned mode is treated as informational metadata
- **AND** the actual execution isolation boundary is the AIO container with `seccomp=unconfined` plus network isolation rather than the reported mode

#### Scenario: Port exposes a sandbox-mode capability
- **WHEN** the `SandboxProvider` port interface is inspected
- **THEN** it exposes the sandbox mode as an informational capability whose values include `read-only`, `workspace-write`, and `danger-full-access`

#### Scenario: Callers depend on the port, not a concrete impl
- **WHEN** orchestrator and runner code that provisions execution is inspected
- **THEN** it depends on the `SandboxProvider` port interface rather than directly on a specific sandbox implementation
- **AND** it consumes the returned `SandboxConnection` handle rather than assuming a `void` provision result

#### Scenario: teardownSandbox is unchanged
- **WHEN** the `teardownSandbox` signature and behavior are inspected after the redesign
- **THEN** they are unchanged from before the AIO migration

### Requirement: Path to restore OS-level isolation is preserved
The `SandboxProvider` port SHALL be defined such that a future implementation can provide OS-level isolation (for example a Claude Code sandbox-runtime) by satisfying the same interface, without requiring changes to the port's consumers.

#### Scenario: A stricter mode is expressible through the same port
- **WHEN** a future implementation is registered that reports a non-`danger-full-access` sandbox mode
- **THEN** existing port consumers use it through the unchanged `SandboxProvider` interface
- **AND** no consumer code requires modification to honor the stricter mode

### Requirement: The transcript read is generalized behind a runtime-declared source-read strategy
The `SandboxProvider` port's transcript read (`readRolloutFromContainer`) SHALL be generalized so
the read strategy is supplied by the task's runtime rather than baked as a single-newest-JSONL
assumption. The provider SHALL resolve WHERE to read from the runtime's `transcriptArtifact(ctx)`
and HOW to read from the runtime's declared `readTranscriptSource` strategy, and SHALL return a
`TranscriptSource` (for codex/claude: `{ format, jsonl: string }`) rather than a bare string. For
the codex and claude single-file path the produced source SHALL be byte-identical in `jsonl`
content to the pre-refactor read — the same lexicographically-newest matching JSONL file's text —
so the existing single-file behavior is preserved. A future multi-record runtime SHALL be able to
supply a non-single-JSONL source through the SAME generalized read seam without breaking the
codex/claude single-file path. The read SHALL remain non-throwing: a miss (no container, no
matching file, unreadable) SHALL resolve to an absent source rather than an error, exactly as
before.

#### Scenario: Codex/claude single-file read returns the same content as before
- **WHEN** the provider reads the transcript for a `codex` or `claude-code` task whose retained container holds the rollout
- **THEN** it resolves the directory + glob from `transcriptArtifact(ctx)`, applies the runtime's single-newest-JSONL `readTranscriptSource` strategy, and returns a `TranscriptSource` whose `jsonl` equals the lexicographically-newest matching file's text — byte-identical to the pre-refactor single-file read

#### Scenario: A multi-record runtime supplies a non-single-JSONL source through the same seam
- **WHEN** a runtime declares a multi-record `readTranscriptSource` strategy
- **THEN** the provider produces that runtime's non-single-JSONL `TranscriptSource` through the same generalized read path, and the codex/claude single-file path is unaffected

#### Scenario: A read miss resolves to an absent source, never an error
- **WHEN** the provider attempts the transcript read but the container is gone, no file matches the glob, or the file is unreadable
- **THEN** the read resolves to an absent source (the prior null-on-miss contract) rather than throwing
